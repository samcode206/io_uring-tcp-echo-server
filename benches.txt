TODO: organize this and document how data is collected

    Request-Response Mode (req-res):
        Behavior: In this mode, the client sends a request (a buffer of random data) to the server and then waits for a response. 
        The client does not send another request until the response for the previous request has been received. 
        This mode represents a synchronous or blocking style of communication.
        The behavior of this mode is somewhat reminiscent of common HTTP/1.1 usage where each request-response pair
        is handled sequentially over a connection.
    

    Streaming Mode (stream):
        Behavior: In this mode, the client simultaneously sends requests and reads responses without waiting for a one-to-one correspondence between requests and responses.
         It uses two separate routines: one for continuously writing data to the server and another for continuously reading data from the server.
         This mode represents an asynchronous or non-blocking style of communication.
         This mode's behavior is analogous to how HTTP/2 can multiplex multiple requests and responses over a single connection,
